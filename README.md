Implemented models
1.Autoregression (AR)
2.Moving Average (MA)
3.Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
4.Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
5.Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA)
6.Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
7.Holt Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing (HWES)

INFERENCE
  The noise in the data has been removed with the help of exponential smoothing. Then the SEASONAL AUTO-REGRESSIVE INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE model is found to be better in predicting the revenue.
